Description: 
    A package for providing a framework of analyzing raw pass data extracted from
    football match video. The pass data needs to be acquired using Paths in the 
    freely available GIMP2 software and exported via the Path2CSV function. The 
    csv files are the basis for a variety of analysis here in this package. The
    palette of analysis ranges from pass heatmaps, passes between areas, shots,
    analysis of position of lost and won balls as well as a summary table 
    with important key parameters.
