# footballmatchanalysis
This is a repository for football match analysis. The prerequites for this repo are
extracted coordinates of passes and shots from a video analysis of a football match 
using the freely available GIMP software tool. Those coordinate files build the 
basis for analysis and visualization of key parameters of the football match.
